<div class="post">
  <h1 class="post-title">Welcome to IRC<sup>tm</sup> </h1>
  <span class="post-date">23 May 2016</span>
</div>

<p>After a bit of wait, the IRC<sup>tm</sup> official website is officially here! Throughout development, we have committed ourselves to providing you with everything you should need to make use of our IRC network. </p>

<p>In development of the site we figured that adding a <b>blog</b> would be a worthwhile addition. IRC<sup>tm</sup> is a server that is constantly continuing to improve, so to document these improvements, we have resorted to maintaining a blog. Here you will find everything we have done to improve the chat server, as well as find news on services we may begin development on in the future.</p>

<p>Here is a documentation of what we've added to the site for your own convenience.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Web Client -</strong> If you are not comfortable using your own downloadable IRC client, we are happy to announce that we have embedded our own web-based client to the site. Using this, you can chat with your friends without the burden of being forced to use third party client.</li>
  <li><strong>Rules -</strong> To help prevent problems in the future, we have provided a rules page to the site, allowing users to be able to easily view the server rules before beginning to chat.</li>
  <li><strong>Premium Hosting -</strong> Have you ever dreamed of free, unlimited SSD hosting? It is time to stop dreaming. With permission, IRC<sup>tm</sup> members are able to access premium hosting, decked out with the latest CPanel distribution as well as premium addons like Softaculous.</li>
  <li><strong>Responsiveness -</strong> Our site is completely responsive, meaning that it can be used on your tablet, phone, and other devices without the site design being compromised.</li>
  
</ul>

<p>Once again, we sincerely wish you are able to make good use of the site. Hope to see you on the chat server!</p>


<p>Yours,</p>

<p>The IRC<sup>tm</sup> Development Team</p>
