      <h3>Rules</h3>

      <p>The #tm channel ("The Channel") is the main channel on the IRC™ network. The Channel is the center of network-wide chat and discussion. The Channel is focused on being a friendly place for all users, new and old, to congregate, chat, and discuss. Like all channels on The Network, the rules and regulations prescribed in "Network-Wide Policies" are fully applicable to The Channel. Similar to The Network, The Channel is also owned, operated, and ruled by the Network Administrator, John. He works to ensure that The Channel is a friendly environment where everyone feels free join in the discussion. In keeping with the aforementioned goals of The Channel, the following set of rules has been established for The Channel:</p>
   
<ul>
  <li><span>IRC&trade; is <b>not</b>&nbsp;a democracy. &nbsp;</span></li>
  <li><span>IRC&trade; is an absolute monarchy with John as the monarch and Network Administrator. This means that The Network in its entirety is controlled and managed&nbsp;solely&nbsp;by John.</span></li>
  <li><span>Upon connecting to IRC&trade;, you agree that you are granted a limited and temporary license to chat subject to this policy and judgments made by John.</span></li>
  <li><span>These rules are&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;the sole governor of The Network. John, as the Network Administrator, makes all decisions relating to The Network; these rules are&nbsp;provided for user&nbsp;convenience&nbsp;in order to provide an&nbsp;understanding of&nbsp;actions and activities that are prohibited by the Network Administrator.</span></li>
  <li><span>John reserves the right to make any decision&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;The Network&nbsp;he wishes.</span></li>
  <li><span>Access to IRC&trade; is a&nbsp;<strong>privilege</strong>, not a right. Access to The Network can be revoked for any user at any time for any reason, with or without notice. While John may attempt to be fair in his rulings, he is free to rule in any way that he wishes and revoke access to The Network or its associated channels for any user, any reason, at any time, with or without notice. Generally, observing good behavior will keep your account and connection in good standing, however, John continues to reserve the right to revoke access to any connection and/or account at any time, with or without notice.</span></li>
  <li><span>A user is <b>not&nbsp;</b>required to be given notice of removal from IRC&trade; or its associated channels; a user may be removed with or without&nbsp;notice to the user and/or other network users&nbsp;at John&#39;s discretion.</span></li>
  <li><span>A user may be removed in any manner from The Network that John chooses, including methods that do not provide explicit notice of removal/license&nbsp;revocation&nbsp;to either the user or the other network and/or channel users.</span></li>
  <li><span>These rules may be updated at any time.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span ><span style="font-size:22px;">Network-Wide Policies</span></span></h2>

<p><span >These policies are classified as Network-Wide Policies. In other words, all of these policies apply to all of&nbsp;IRC&trade;, in all channels and areas of the network.</span></p>

<ul>
  <li><span >Harassment of other users of the network in any way, shape, or form is&nbsp;prohibited on The Network.</span></li>
  <li><span >Engaging in and/or inciting riots is strictly prohibited on The Network and will result in the immediate removal of participants for an indefinite amount of time.</span></li>
  <li><span >Creating a hostile environment for other user(s), including messages and/or actions that are intended to intimidate.</span></li>
  <li><span >If you are banned from The Network, do not attempt to evade the ban in any manner; bans on The Network are issued by host name and IP address and upon banishment, all clients connecting from the banned host name and IP address,&nbsp;including those that do not belong to the banned user,&nbsp;are strictly prohibited from connecting.</span></li>
  <li><span >You may not, by any means, assist or facilitate banned users in interacting with users through The Network. This includes, but is not limited to, providing proxies or relay bots for the use of banned users.</span></li>
  <li><span >Follow all directions provided by the Network Administrator immediately. The Network Administrator has final determination in all matters relating to The Network. Refusing to do something when asked by the Network Administrator constitutes a violation of this rule and as a result your license to use The Network will be revoked.</span></li>
  <li><span >Friendly bots are welcomed onto the network, provided they do <strong>not</strong> do any of the following:</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a. Enter a channel without permission from the channel owner.</span></p>

<p><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b. Flood the network and/or any channel on it.</span></p>

<p><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c. Log channels or messages&nbsp;in any manner&nbsp;without the channel owner&#39;s permission.</span></p>

<p><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d. Advertise for third parties without the channel owner&#39;s permission.</span></p>

<p><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; e. Engage in activities associated with botnets.</span></p>

<p><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d. Attempt to send harmful material, such as malware.</span></p>

<ul>
  <li><span >Spamming is strictly prohibited on The Network. Spamming includes, but is not limited to, the advertising or promotion of free, pay, personal, commercial, corporate, non-profit, or private web sites, products, programs, other chat programs and/or services, other IRC channels, and/or other IRC networks.</span></li>
  <li><span >Any attempt or participation in illicit activities on or against&nbsp;IRC&trade; and its users is strictly prohibited.</span></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<b><h3><span>#tm Channel Specific Policies</span></h3></b>

<p><span >The #tm channel (&quot;The Channel&quot;) is the main channel on the IRC&trade; network. The Channel is the center of network-wide chat and discussion. The Channel is focused on being a friendly place for all users, new and old, to congregate, chat, and discuss.&nbsp;Like all channels on The Network, the rules and regulations prescribed in &quot;Network-Wide Policies&quot; are fully applicable to The Channel. Similar to The Network, The Channel is also owned, operated, and ruled by the Network Administrator, John. He works to ensure that The Channel is a friendly environment where everyone feels free join in the discussion. In keeping with the aforementioned goals of The Channel, the following set of rules has been established for The Channel:</span></p>

<ul>
  <li><span >You may not engage in speech that is intimidating or demeaning to another user of The Channel, such as insults or obscene name-calling. Disagreements do often happen between users; this is&nbsp;<strong>no</strong><strong>&nbsp;excuse&nbsp;</strong>for attempting to demean or intimidate another user of The Channel.&nbsp;</span></li>
  <li><span >Disagreements among users in The Channel shall be discussed in a civil manner; the rule above is especially applicable to disagreements, where parties may be angered. Disagreements in The Channel should be discussed in a fully civil manner, with intelligent discussion taking place. Please take disagreements lightly; they happen and are not something to get angered about.</span></li>
  <li><span >Bots that are not run by the Network Administrator are forbidden from The Channel. To ensure the safety and security of The Channel, third party bots are not allowed in The Channel; however, if you have written a robot that you believe could be beneficial to The Channel, you may provide the source code for the Network Administrator to run in official capacity for the benefit of The Channel at the Network Administrator&#39;s discretion.</span></li>
  <li><span >Ensure that you are following the channel etiquette described below. This&nbsp;etiquette&nbsp;is made to ensure that the tone of The Channel remains a friendly, welcoming&nbsp;environment where all users&nbsp;can engage&nbsp;in chat and discussion.</span></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h3><span >#tm&nbsp;Channel Etiquette</span></h2>

<p><span >IRC is a low-band&shy;width method of com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion, in com&shy;par&shy;i&shy;son with phys&shy;i&shy;cal pres&shy;ence. Many of the cues of phys&shy;i&shy;cal com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion, tone of voice, fa&shy;cial ex&shy;pres&shy;sion, hand move&shy;ments, etc., are miss&shy;ing in IRC, since only text is trans&shy;mit&shy;ted back and forth. Speakers in phys&shy;i&shy;cal prox&shy;im&shy;i&shy;ty with each oth&shy;er com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;cate quite a bit of emo&shy;tion&shy;al con&shy;text via this ex&shy;tra band&shy;width. This con&shy;text en&shy;ables them to avoid mis&shy;judg&shy;ing the in&shy;tent of their con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion&shy;al part&shy;ners. It also func&shy;tions as an un&shy;con&shy;scious neg&shy;a&shy;tive feed&shy;back mech&shy;a&shy;nism to re&shy;duce the in&shy;ci&shy;dence of emo&shy;tion&shy;al &quot;firestorms&quot; which tend to dis&shy;rupt the ef&shy;fi&shy;cient flow of con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion. Hu&shy;man be&shy;ings look for this feed&shy;back, and in&shy;deed they may have evolved to re&shy;quire it. In the low-band&shy;width world of IRC, they must in&shy;stead rely on emo&shy;tion&shy;al feed&shy;back from the text they re&shy;ceive.</span></p>

<p><span >This process is sub&shy;ject to ex&shy;ag&shy;ger&shy;a&shy;tion. Small amounts of emo&shy;tion be&shy;come mag&shy;ni&shy;fied in the per&shy;cep&shy;tion of the ob&shy;serv&shy;er. So, it is very im&shy;por&shy;tant to keep chan&shy;nels calm. An in&shy;for&shy;mal con&shy;cep&shy;tu&shy;al mea&shy;sure&shy;ment of the emo&shy;tion&shy;al con&shy;tent of a chan&shy;nel is its &quot;chan&shy;nel tem&shy;per&shy;a&shy;ture.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span >Think of a per&shy;son&shy;&#39;s emo&shy;tion&shy;al state as ki&shy;net&shy;ic en&shy;er&shy;gy. En&shy;thu&shy;si&shy;asm, hap&shy;pi&shy;ness, anger, frus&shy;tra&shy;tion all add to the en&shy;er&shy;gy lev&shy;el. The more emo&shy;tion is ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced, the &quot;hot&shy;ter&quot; the par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pant. The av&shy;er&shy;age emo&shy;tion&shy;al state of a chan&shy;nel is its tem&shy;per&shy;a&shy;ture. Emo&shy;tions in IRC be&shy;come ex&shy;ag&shy;ger&shy;at&shy;ed and con&shy;vey&shy;ing them di&shy;rect&shy;ly in&shy;creas&shy;es chan&shy;nel tem&shy;per&shy;a&shy;ture. Pen&shy;t-up frus&shy;tra&shy;tion, in par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar, is of&shy;ten re&shy;leased as a se&shy;ries of in&shy;ap&shy;pro&shy;pri&shy;ate, &quot;high en&shy;er&shy;gy&quot; out&shy;bursts. An im&shy;por&shy;tant ob&shy;jec&shy;tive of The Channel&nbsp;guide&shy;lines is to avoid &quot;feed&shy;back loops&quot; in chan&shy;nel in&shy;ter&shy;ac&shy;tions by re&shy;duc&shy;ing chan&shy;nel tem&shy;per&shy;a&shy;ture.</span></p>

<p><span >The guide&shy;lines which fol&shy;low are de&shy;signed with the ben&shy;e&shy;fit of years of ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence with IRC. Every&shy;one is a user, re&shy;gard&shy;less of their priv&shy;i&shy;lege lev&shy;el, and each user has the abil&shy;i&shy;ty to in&shy;flu&shy;ence the us&shy;abil&shy;i&shy;ty of the chan&shy;nel.</span></p>

<p></p>

<h3><span >Etiquette Guidelines</span></h3>

<p></p>

<ul>
  <li><span >Pol&shy;ish your cat&shy;a&shy;lyst skills. The cat&shy;a&shy;lyst role is cru&shy;cial to keep&shy;ing chan&shy;nel in&shy;ter&shy;ac&shy;tions friend&shy;ly and ef&shy;fi&shy;cient.</span></li>
  <li><span >Look for the best in peo&shy;ple. If you as&shy;sume peo&shy;ple have no self&shy;-&shy;con&shy;trol, they will con&shy;firm your be&shy;lief. If you look for per&shy;son&shy;al re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty, and ask for per&shy;son&shy;al re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty, most peo&shy;ple will re&shy;spond well.</span></li>
  <li><span >Set a good ex&shy;am&shy;ple. Be what you want oth&shy;er peo&shy;ple to be. If you want them to be calm, be calm. If you want them to be cour&shy;te&shy;ous and friend&shy;ly, be cour&shy;te&shy;ous and friend&shy;ly. The ha&shy;bit&shy;u&shy;al be&shy;hav&shy;iour of peo&shy;ple on a chan&shy;nel is the most pow&shy;er&shy;ful in&shy;flu&shy;ence on new&shy;bies ar&shy;riv&shy;ing on the chan&shy;nel.</span></li>
  <li><span >Be nice if some&shy;one mes&shy;sages you. They have gone to the trou&shy;ble to seek out you&nbsp;to chat and/or help&nbsp;them. You are it! Be flat&shy;tered they have sin&shy;gled you out. If they have a question and&nbsp;you think they will get bet&shy;ter discussion&nbsp;by ask&shy;ing their ques&shy;tion in The Chan&shy;nel, just let them know.</span></li>
  <li><span >Avoid high&shy;light&shy;ing and rep&shy;e&shy;ti&shy;tion. Words and sen&shy;tences in al&shy;l-up&shy;per&shy;case, heavy use of high&shy;light&shy;ing, beep&shy;ing (^G) on pub&shy;lic chan&shy;nels, re&shy;peat&shy;ing the same lines over and over--all of these be&shy;hav&shy;iours ir&shy;ri&shy;tate peo&shy;ple and raise the chan&shy;nel tem&shy;per&shy;a&shy;ture.</span></li>
  <li><span >Take crit&shy;i&shy;cism to pri&shy;vate mes&shy;sage. Crit&shy;i&shy;cis&shy;ing some&shy;one&#39;s be&shy;hav&shy;iour on The Chan&shy;nel holds them up to pub&shy;lic scruti&shy;ny in a neg&shy;a&shy;tive way. It&#39;s usu&shy;al&shy;ly overkill. Re&shy;quest nice&shy;ly that they change their be&shy;hav&shy;iour. In many cas&shy;es you will dis&shy;cov&shy;er that prob&shy;lem user you are deal&shy;ing with is mere&shy;ly in&shy;ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced. An ag&shy;gres&shy;sive tone makes for a longer and more in&shy;volved dis&shy;cus&shy;sion, and pen&shy;t-up frus&shy;tra&shy;tion which will raise the chan&shy;nel tem&shy;per&shy;a&shy;ture soon&shy;er or lat&shy;er.&nbsp;</span></li>
  <li><span >Don&#39;t be elit&shy;ist. To&shy;day&#39;s new&shy;bies are to&shy;mor&shy;row&#39;s ex&shy;perts.&nbsp;Is the ex&shy;am&shy;ple you want to set that knowl&shy;edge is a hi&shy;er&shy;ar&shy;chy of con&shy;trol, or that peo&shy;ple with knowl&shy;edge have an in&shy;her&shy;ent so&shy;cial ad&shy;van&shy;tage over peo&shy;ple who do not? Help&shy;ing oth&shy;er peo&shy;ple takes pa&shy;tience. It is bet&shy;ter not to an&shy;swer a ques&shy;tion than to use the op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ty to em&shy;pha&shy;sise the lim&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tions of the per&shy;son you are try&shy;ing to help.</span></li>
  <li><span >Do not flood channels or private messages with ASCII art. Ask first if you have something to share.</span></li>
  <li><span >Avoid calling people names or insulting them. Words like moron, n00b, and retard aren&rsquo;t very nice.</span></li>
  <li><span >Ask before you send someone notice, and/or CTCP requests. It&rsquo;s like whispering in someone&rsquo;s ear without permission.</span></li>
  <li><span >AME and AMSG should be used sparingly, and only for very important messages. Broadcast messages that are sent to every channel you are in are considered impolite.</span></li>
  <li><span >Avoid changing your nick frequently. It gets annoying if you are changing to nicks like Steven|school, Steven|work, Steven|afk, Steven|bacon, and Steven|eating. Just choose a nick, and stick with it. It&rsquo;s unlikely anyone needs that much detail on what you&rsquo;re doing.</span></li>
  <li><span >Make sure people understand your tone. On IRC, we can&rsquo;t see your face or hear your voice.</span></li>
  <li><span >Avoid flame wars, trolling, and spamming.</span></li>
